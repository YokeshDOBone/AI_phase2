## Introduction

The earthquake prediction model is designed to forecast the likelihood and magnitude of future seismic events using historical earthquake data. The model aims to provide early warnings and improve disaster preparedness in earthquake-prone regions.

## Dataset Source

The earthquake dataset used for this model was sourced from the kaggle website . You can access the dataset and learn more about it at the following URL :(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usgs/earthquake-database )

**Dataset Description**:

The dataset contains information on earthquakes from 1960 to 2016. Key columns include `latitude`, `longitude`, `depth`, `magnitude`, `date`, and `time`. You can customize the dataset with additional features or use your own data for prediction.

## Dependencies

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running Jupyter notebooks)

You can install these packages using `pip`:


Pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib


## Installation

1.	Clone this repository to your local machine:


Git clone https://github.com/Yokesh/AI_phase5.git

2.	Change to the project directory:


cd earthquake-prediction-model


## Usage

To use the earthquake prediction model, follow these steps:

1.	Ensure you have installed all the dependencies mentioned above.

2.	Prepare your earthquake dataset. Replace `earthquake_data.csv` with your dataset file in the code.


3.	Run the code using a Python environment. You can run the provided Python script or Jupyter notebook files, depending on your preference.

## Model Training

The code provided includes the model training process. You can adjust the machine learning algorithm, hyperparameters, and feature engineering steps to fit your specific dataset and requirements.

## Visualization

The code includes options for visualizing earthquake data on a world map using Matplotlib. You can customize the visualization and map settings to suit your needs.
